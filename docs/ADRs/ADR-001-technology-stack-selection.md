# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Deciders:** Platform Team  
**Consulted:** Development Team  
**Informed:** All Engineers  

## Context

We are building an internal tooling platform that needs to support multiple applications with shared services. The platform must:

- Enable fast developer onboarding with minimal context switching
- Support rapid development of new internal tools
- Provide consistent patterns across all applications
- Be maintainable by teams with varying experience levels
- Support future scaling and deployment flexibility

### Requirements

- **Developer Experience**: Minimal context switching between services and applications
- **Consistency**: Uniform patterns and conventions across the platform
- **Documentation**: Extensive ecosystem documentation and community support
- **Performance**: Adequate performance for internal tools (not public-facing)
- **Maintainability**: Easy to debug, extend, and modify
- **Future-Proofing**: Ability to package services and create SDKs
- **Deployment**: Platform-agnostic deployment capabilities

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Backend Services
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Testing**: Jest with supertest
- **Validation**: Class-validator and class-transformer

### Frontend Applications
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Custom design system
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **HTTP Client**: Native fetch with custom abstraction

### Shared Infrastructure
- **Language**: TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- **Package Manager**: npm with workspaces
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Process Management**: PM2 for production
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: Winston + structured logging

## Rationale

### TypeScript Everywhere
- **Single Language**: Reduces cognitive load and context switching
- **Type Safety**: Shared types between frontend and backend
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- **Community**: Large ecosystem and extensive documentation

### NestJS for Backend
- **Architecture**: Built-in dependency injection and modular architecture
- **Decorators**: Similar patterns to Next.js and React
- **Documentation**: Excellent documentation and learning resources
- **Testing**: Built-in testing utilities and patterns
- **Ecosystem**: Large ecosystem of modules and integrations
- **API-First**: Native OpenAPI support for documentation and SDK generation
- **Future-Ready**: Easy to package as npm modules or standalone services

### Next.js for Frontend
- **Full-Stack**: Built-in API routes for self-contained applications
- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations (Image, Font, Bundle optimization)
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, TypeScript support, excellent debugging
- **Deployment**: Platform-agnostic deployment options
- **Ecosystem**: Large React ecosystem and component libraries
- **Self-Contained**: Each app can operate independently

### PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested database for enterprise applications
- **Developer Experience**: Type-safe database access with Prisma
- **Migrations**: Built-in migration system
- **Performance**: Excellent performance for internal tools scale
- **Deployment**: Available on all major cloud platforms

### Complementary Choices
- **Redis**: Fast caching and session storage
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Radix UI**: Accessible, unstyled components
- **Docker**: Consistent development and deployment environments

## Alternatives Considered

### Backend Alternatives

**Express.js**
- ✅ Lightweight and flexible
- ✅ Large ecosystem
- ❌ Lacks built-in structure (requires more setup)
- ❌ No built-in TypeScript support
- ❌ Manual dependency injection setup

**Fastify**
- ✅ High performance
- ✅ TypeScript support
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem compared to NestJS
- ❌ Less opinionated (more decisions required)

**tRPC + Express**
- ✅ Type-safe API calls
- ✅ Great TypeScript integration
- ❌ Less suitable for REST APIs
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem for internal tools patterns

### Frontend Alternatives

**React + Vite**
- ✅ Fast development server
- ✅ Flexible configuration
- ❌ No built-in API routes (requires separate backend)
- ❌ More configuration required
- ❌ Not self-contained

**SvelteKit**
- ✅ Great performance
- ✅ Full-stack framework
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Less familiar to team
- ❌ Different patterns from backend

**Remix**
- ✅ Full-stack React framework
- ✅ Great developer experience
- ❌ Different patterns from NestJS
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Consistency**: TypeScript and decorator patterns across frontend and backend
- **Developer Experience**: Minimal context switching, excellent tooling
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation for both frameworks
- **Future-Proofing**: Easy to extract services as packages or SDKs
- **Self-Contained Apps**: Each Next.js app can operate independently
- **API-First**: Built-in OpenAPI support for service integration
- **Platform Agnostic**: Can deploy to any cloud provider or on-premises

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need to learn NestJS patterns (mitigated by good docs)
- **Bundle Size**: TypeScript and decorators add some overhead
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Some coupling to NestJS and Next.js patterns

### Neutral
- **Performance**: Adequate for internal tools, not optimized for high-traffic public sites
- **Team Size**: Well-suited for small to medium development teams

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Set up shared services with NestJS
   - Authentication service
   - User management service
   - Basic infrastructure

2. **Phase 2**: Create first Next.js application (Resource Management)
   - Integrate with shared services
   - Establish patterns and conventions

3. **Phase 3**: Document patterns and create templates
   - Create application templates
   - Document best practices
   - Set up development workflows

4. **Phase 4**: Build additional applications
   - Skills Assessment
   - Knowledge Base
   - Iterate on patterns

## Review Date

This decision will be reviewed in 6 months (December 2025) to assess:
- Developer productivity and satisfaction
- Performance and scalability
- Maintenance burden
- Ecosystem evolution
