# ADR-002: Shared Services Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Deciders:** Platform Team, Architecture Team  
**Consulted:** Development Team  
**Informed:** All Engineers  

## Context

We are building multiple internal applications that will share common functionality such as:

- User authentication and authorization
- User profile management
- Notification systems (email, in-app, Slack)
- File upload and management
- Audit logging and compliance
- Organization settings and configuration

Each application should be self-contained but leverage shared services to avoid code duplication and ensure consistency across the platform.

### Requirements

- **DRY Principle**: Avoid duplicating common functionality across applications
- **Consistency**: Uniform behavior for authentication, notifications, etc.
- **Independence**: Applications should be deployable and testable independently
- **Scalability**: Shared services should scale independently of applications
- **Future-Proofing**: Services should be packageable and SDK-ready
- **API-First**: All services should expose well-documented APIs
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Support multiple organizations in the same deployment

## Decision

We will implement a **microservices architecture** with centralized shared services and self-contained Next.js applications.

## Implementation Strategy

This architecture provides the foundation for a scalable, maintainable internal tools platform with clear separation of concerns between shared functionality and application-specific features.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality implemented once
- **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across all applications  
- **Independence**: Applications can be developed and deployed separately
- **Scalability**: Services scale independently based on demand
- **Maintainability**: Centralized updates to shared functionality

## Consequences

- **Network Latency**: Applications depend on shared services over HTTP
- **Complexity**: More components to deploy and monitor
- **Service Dependencies**: Applications require shared services to be available

## Review Date

This architecture will be reviewed in 6 months (December 2025) to assess performance, scalability, and developer productivity.
