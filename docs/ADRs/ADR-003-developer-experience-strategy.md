# ADR-003: Developer Experience Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Deciders:** Platform Team, Development Team  
**Consulted:** All Engineers  
**Informed:** Management, QA Team  

## Context

Our organization expects fast developer turnover and needs to ensure that new developers can be productive quickly. We need a development experience that minimizes context switching, provides clear patterns, and enables rapid onboarding.

### Current Challenges

- **Fast Turnover**: Developers may work on the platform for 3-6 months
- **Varying Experience**: Mix of junior and senior developers
- **Multiple Projects**: Developers may work on multiple internal tools
- **Context Switching**: Need to minimize cognitive load between services and apps
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform patterns across all projects
- **Documentation**: Must be comprehensive and discoverable

### Requirements

- **One-Command Setup**: New developers should be able to start development with minimal setup
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar code structures across all services and applications
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Everything should be documented with examples
- **Template-Based Development**: Quick scaffolding for new applications
- **Minimal Context Switching**: Similar patterns between frontend and backend
- **Self-Service**: Developers should be able to find answers without asking others
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick development cycles with hot reload and fast tests

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive developer experience strategy focused on:

1. **Standardized Development Environment**
2. **Consistent Code Patterns and Conventions**
3. **Template-Based Application Creation**
4. **Comprehensive Documentation with Examples**
5. **Automated Development Workflows**
6. **Self-Service Tooling**

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. One-Command Setup

```bash
# Single command to get started
npm run setup:dev
```

This command will:
1. Install all dependencies across the monorepo
2. Start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
3. Run database migrations and seed data
4. Start all services in development mode
5. Open browser to development dashboard

### 2. Consistent Patterns

**File Naming:**
- Components: PascalCase (`UserProfile.tsx`)
- Files: kebab-case (`user-service.ts`)
- Directories: kebab-case (`shared-services/`)

**API Patterns:**
```typescript
// Consistent API response format
export interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  status: 'success' | 'error';
  message?: string;
  pagination?: PaginationMeta;
}

// Consistent error handling
export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    public message: string,
    public code?: string
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

### 3. Template-Based Development

```bash
# Create new application
npm run create:app skills-assessment

# This creates:
# - Complete Next.js app structure
# - Pre-configured shared services integration
# - Docker configuration
# - Basic CRUD operations
# - Authentication setup
# - Development scripts
```

### 4. Quality Gates

All code must pass:
- ✅ Type checking
- ✅ Linting
- ✅ Unit tests (>80% coverage)
- ✅ Build process
- ✅ Code review approval

## Benefits

### For New Developers
- **Fast Onboarding**: Productive within hours, not days
- **Clear Patterns**: Consistent code structure reduces confusion
- **Self-Service**: Find answers without asking teammates
- **Quick Feedback**: Fast development cycles with hot reload

### For Teams
- **Reduced Mentoring**: Less time spent helping new developers
- **Consistent Quality**: Automated quality gates ensure standards
- **Faster Delivery**: Templates and patterns speed up development
- **Better Maintenance**: Consistent code is easier to maintain

### For Organization
- **Lower Risk**: Fast turnover doesn't impact delivery
- **Higher Quality**: Consistent patterns and automated testing
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Rapid application development
- **Better Documentation**: Everything is documented with examples

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Developer Onboarding**: New developers productive in hours
- **Consistent Code Quality**: Automated quality gates and patterns
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Similar patterns across all projects
- **Self-Service Development**: Comprehensive documentation and tooling
- **Rapid Application Development**: Templates and scaffolding

### Negative
- **Initial Setup Cost**: Time investment to create templates and documentation
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Need to keep templates and docs updated
- **Pattern Lock-in**: Teams may be constrained by established patterns

### Mitigations
- **Regular Reviews**: Review and update patterns quarterly
- **Feedback Loops**: Collect developer feedback and iterate
- **Escape Hatches**: Allow deviations with proper justification
- **Community Ownership**: Teams collectively maintain standards

## Review Date

This strategy will be reviewed in 3 months (September 2025) to assess:
- Developer onboarding time
- Developer satisfaction scores
- Code quality metrics
- Development velocity
